## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-09

### Added
- **Multi-Provider AI Support**: Added OpenRouter as an alternative to AWS Bedrock
  - OpenRouter client with full API integration (`openrouter-api-key` input)
  - Support for free OpenRouter models (Kimi K2, Gemini 2.0 Flash, DeepSeek, etc.)
  - Automatic provider detection based on model selection
- **Intelligent Model Selection System**: Priority-based model selection with fallback support
  - `models` input parameter for comma-separated model priority lists
  - ModelSelector class for parsing and managing model priorities  
  - Auto-detection of provider (AWS/OpenRouter) based on model names
  - Support for mixing different model types with intelligent routing
- **Smart Fallback System**: Automatic handling of rate limits and model failures
  - FallbackManager class for intelligent model switching and retry logic
  - Rate limit detection with automatic switching to next available model
  - Periodic retry mechanism (every 5 requests) with 5-minute cooldown for rate-limited models
  - Failure tracking with temporary model disabling after 2 consecutive failures
  - Recovery system that resets failed models when all options are exhausted
- **Enhanced Configuration Options**: 
  - `ai-provider` input for explicit provider selection (`aws`, `openrouter`, `auto`)
  - Improved model-specific defaults (Kimi K2 Free for OpenRouter, Claude 3.7 Sonnet for AWS)
  - Better error handling and retry logic for both providers
  - Comprehensive logging and debugging for fallback behavior
- **Cost Flexibility**: Users can now choose between free OpenRouter models and premium AWS Bedrock models

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Default behavior now uses only Kimi K2 Free model when no configuration provided (no mixed providers)
- Updated all documentation to reflect multi-provider capabilities
- Enhanced README with comprehensive setup guides for both providers
- Improved error messages with provider-specific context
- Updated package.json description to reflect multi-provider support

### Fixed
- Fixed undefined display names for default models in model selection
- Improved token limit handling for different model context sizes
- Enhanced API error handling with provider-specific retry logic

### Technical Details
- Added `openrouter-client.js` with full OpenRouter API v1 compatibility and fallback integration
- Added `ai-provider.js` factory pattern for provider management  
- Added `model-selector.js` for intelligent model parsing and selection
- Added `fallback-manager.js` with sophisticated rate limiting and failure handling
- Updated `bedrock-client.js` to accept configurable model parameters
- Enhanced `index.js` with multi-provider orchestration and fallback system integration
- Comprehensive test suite for fallback scenarios with real-world simulation

## [2.0.0] - 2025-05-10

### Added
- Support for configurable parameters through GitHub Action inputs:
  - `max-tokens`: Maximum number of tokens for Claude to generate (default: 64000)
  - `enable-thinking`: Enable Claude's extended thinking capability (default: true)
  - `thinking-budget`: Token budget for Claude's thinking process (default: 1024)
  - `extended-output`: Enable 128K extended output capability (default: true)
  - `request-timeout`: API request timeout in milliseconds (default: 3600000)
  - `max-requests`: Maximum number of requests to make to AWS Bedrock (default: 10)
  - `required-label`: Label required on PR for processing (default: claudecoder)

### Changed
- Upgraded to Claude 3.7 Sonnet model from AWS Bedrock
- Increased default max tokens from 4000 to 64000
- Implemented extended thinking capability with a default budget of 1024 tokens
- Enabled extended output length (128K tokens) by default
- Enhanced response processing to handle thinking blocks
- Improved error handling for token validation errors
- Updated all documentation to consistently reference "Claude 3.7 Sonnet"
- Increased API timeout to 60 minutes (3600000 ms) as recommended in AWS documentation

### Fixed
- Improved error handling for validation exceptions
- Better handling of API timeouts for large responses
- Updated model ID format to use the inference profile ID required for AWS Bedrock cross-region inference (`us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0`)

### BREAKING CHANGES
- PRs now require a label (default: 'claudecoder') to be processed by the action
- Existing workflows will need to be updated to add labels to PRs that should be processed
- Workflow triggers should be updated to include the 'labeled' event type for optimal performance
