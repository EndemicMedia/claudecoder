## ‚ú® Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Code Changes** - Harness Claude 3.7 Sonnet's intelligence to analyze PR descriptions and automatically implement suggested changes
- üîÑ **Seamless GitHub Integration** - Works directly within your existing GitHub workflow with zero disruption to your development process
- üõ†Ô∏è **Highly Configurable** - Customize token limits, thinking capabilities, response handling, and more to fit your team's specific needs
- üîç **Context-Aware** - Analyzes your entire repository to ensure changes align with your existing codebase
- **Accelerated Development** - Save time on routine code changes and let your team focus on strategic work
- üîí **Security-Focused** - Your code stays within your own GitHub and AWS environments

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you can use ClaudeCoderAction, you need to have:

1. An AWS account with access to AWS Bedrock
2. AWS credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) with permissions to invoke AWS Bedrock
3. A GitHub repository where you want to use this action

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS Access Key ID
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS Secret Access Key

2. Create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/claudecoder.yml`) in your repository with the following content:

```yaml
name: ClaudeCoder

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, labeled]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]

jobs:
  process-pr:
    # Only run this job if the PR has the 'claudecoder' label
    # This is a recommended filter at the workflow level for efficiency
    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'claudecoder')
    permissions: write-all
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: ClaudeCoderAction
      uses: EndemicMedia/claudecoder@v2.0.0
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        # The following is optional - defaults to 'claudecoder'
        required-label: 'claudecoder'
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

ClaudeCoderAction will automatically run on pull requests that have the "claudecoder" label. It will:

1. Verify that the PR has the required label (default: "claudecoder")
2. Analyze the repository content and the pull request description
3. Generate code suggestions using Claude 3.7 Sonnet
4. Apply the suggested changes to the pull request branch
5. Add a comment to the pull request with a summary of the changes

To use ClaudeCoder on a pull request:
1. Create or edit a pull request
2. Add the "claudecoder" label to the PR
3. Wait for ClaudeCoder to process the PR and suggest changes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can configure ClaudeCoderAction using the following inputs in your workflow file:

### Basic Configuration
- `aws-region`: The AWS region to use (default: `us-east-1`)
- `max-requests`: Maximum number of requests to make to AWS Bedrock (default: `10`)
- `required-label`: Label required on PR for processing (default: `claudecoder`)

### Advanced Claude 3.7 Sonnet Configuration
- `max-tokens`: Maximum number of tokens for Claude to generate (default: `64000`, up to 128K)
- `enable-thinking`: Enable Claude's extended thinking capability (default: `true`)
- `thinking-budget`: Token budget for Claude's thinking process (default: `1024`, minimum required by the API)
- `extended-output`: Enable 128K extended output capability (default: `true`)
- `request-timeout`: API request timeout in milliseconds (default: `3600000` - 60 minutes)

Example with custom configuration:

```yaml
- uses: EndemicMedia/claudecoder@v2.0.0
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: eu-west-1
    max-requests: 5
    max-tokens: 32000
    enable-thinking: true
    thinking-budget: 2000
    extended-output: true
    request-timeout: 1800000
    required-label: 'ai-review' # Custom label
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Label Filtering Options

You can implement label filtering in two ways:

1. **Workflow-level filtering (recommended)**: Using the `if` condition in your workflow file as shown in the setup example:
   ```yaml
   if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'claudecoder')
   ```
   This prevents the job from running entirely when the label is not present, saving computational resources.

2. **Action-level filtering (built-in)**: The action itself checks for the required label and exits gracefully if missing, adding a comment to inform users. This acts as a safety mechanism even if workflow-level filtering is not set up.

We recommend using both approaches for optimal efficiency and user experience.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- ClaudeCoderAction is designed to suggest changes, but it's important to review all suggestions before merging.
- The action is limited by the capabilities of Claude 3.7 Sonnet and may not understand very complex or domain-specific code patterns.
- There's a limit to the amount of repository content that can be analyzed due to API constraints.
